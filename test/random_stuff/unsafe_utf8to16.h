// This file just explains why there is almost no differency in performance between safe and unsafe UTF-8 algorithms.

// Two unsafe (they don't check for ill-formed sequences) utf8to16 functions implemented here.
// One with boundary checks and one without them.

// First function is faster than the current safe algorithm is about 0-5% and it really looks like a fluctuation.
// Second function is about 20-30% faster than the current.
// So it seems safety checks don't affect performance much and the real culprit is boundary check.
// My guess is branch predictor it can easy predict safety checks but it cannot predict boudary
// so safety checks can be "skipped" by branch predictor but every boudary check must be perfomed so they do affect performance.
// ---
// With random bytes test the difference between first function and the current algo is about 10-20%
// so it doesn't look like a fluctuation anymore. So it seems my guess is right and it is the branch predictor.
// Of course it doesn't matter for real UTF-8 text, there won't be any misspredictions almost always.
// ---
// TLDR there is no difference in performance between safe and unsafe UTF-8 functions
// so we don't need them or some define for that crap to achive a better performance.

// Unsafe with bound checks
